**Theft Detection Algorithm using Video Data**
This repository contains the code and documentation for building a theft detection algorithm using video data, specifically focusing on shoplifting scenarios. The algorithm is designed to classify video frames or clips as containing shoplifting or not containing shoplifting.

**Dataset**
The theft detection algorithm is built using the DCSASS dataset, which contains a variety of video clips categorized into different activities, including shoplifting. Only videos labeled as "shoplifting" are used for this project.

Dataset: DCSASS Dataset


**Tasks**
The project is structured into the following tasks:
Data Preprocessing: Download the DCSASS dataset and filter for videos labeled as "shoplifting." Preprocess the videos by converting them into a suitable format for machine learning models.
Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the preprocessed videos that can be used to identify shoplifting activities.
Model Building: Develop a machine learning model to classify video frames/clips as containing shoplifting or not containing shoplifting.
Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model using relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 Score.


**File Structure**
data/: Contains the DCSASS dataset.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.
src/: Source code for the theft detection algorithm.
README.md: This file providing an overview of the project.
